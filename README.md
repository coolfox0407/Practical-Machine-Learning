# Practical-Machine-Learning

This project assignment is part of "Practical Machine Learning" course at Coursera's "Data Science" specialization. Goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and obtain a prediction algorithm that correctly predicts the type of class (A to E), which is the **"classe"** variable in the training set. This project uses the "Weight Lifting Exercises" dataset. More information on this dataset is available **[here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)**

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify **"how much"** of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify **"how well"** they do it.

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.

Dataset will be analyzed using exploratory analysis and the following ML algorithms will be used to model the training datasets. Best one of the below three ML algorithms will be used for predictions in the test dataset.

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forests
3. Generalized Boosted Regression
